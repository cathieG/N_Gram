**IMPORTANT**: As of right now, our code is not a script and cannot be interacted on command line. Everything is in google Colab(.ipynb). This README will be updated after we modity our code to be a script.


# **1. Introduction**  
This project explores **code completion in Java**, leveraging **N-gram language modeling**. The N-gram model predicts the next token in a sequence by learning the probability distributions of token occurrences in training data. The model selects the most probable token based on learned patterns, making it a fundamental technique in natural language processing and software engineering automation.

# **2. Getting Started**  

This project is implemented in **Python 3.9+** and is compatible with **macOS, Linux, and Windows**.  

## **2.1 Preparations**  

(1) Clone the repository to your workspace:  
```shell
~ $ git clone https://github.com/cathieG/N_Gram.git
```
(2) Navigate into the repository: (change according to your directory structure)
```shell
~ $ cd your-project
~/your-project $
```
(3) Set up a virtual environment and activate it: (change according to your directory structure)

For macOS/Linux:
```shell
~/your-project $ python -m venv ./venv/
~/your-project $ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) ~/your-project $ 
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, use the command:
```shell
(venv) $ deactivate
```

## **2.2 Install Packages**

Install the required dependencies:
```shell
(venv) ~/your-project $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## **2.3 Run N-gram**

(1) Run N-gram Demo

The script takes a corpus of Java methods as input and automatically identifies the best-performing model based on a specific N-value. It then evaluates the selected model on the test set extracted according to the assignment specifications.
Since the training corpus differs from both the instructor-provided dataset and our own dataset, we store the results in a file named results_provided_model.[json/csv/txt] to distinguish them accordingly.
```shell
(venv) ~/your-project $ python ngram.py corpus.txt
```
## 3. Report

The assignment report is available in the file Assignment_Report.pdf.
